# crib_ai
An ai implementation of crib

The plan is to build a utiltily based agent that can play an optimal game of crib. An optimal game of crib would be one that the agent statistically picks the best cards to discard in each hand and always plays an optimal card based on possible pegging. 

The first goal to reach is have the game setup and being able to play a game against a random agent. 

The next step is to implemnt an agent that can optimpally discard cards to the crib.

lastly the implmeneation of playing cards in the pegging phase will be compleated.
